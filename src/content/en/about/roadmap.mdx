# Roadmap & Changelog

We are building FXST in the open. This means you can track our progress, see what we’re currently working on, and look back at how far we’ve come.

## 🗺️ Our Roadmap
This is our vision for the near future. While priorities can shift as we learn and grow, these are the milestones we are aiming for:

### 🟢 Short Term
Our immediate focus is on perfecting our core services and building a strong foundation.

* **FDM Workflows:** Finalizing our filament printing processes and expanding internal documentation to ensure consistent quality.
* **Web Services:** Developing a powerful web architecture to serve as the main hub for FXST. This includes local server and database management, CDN setup, secure payment portals, and a beautiful, intuitive UI/UX.
* **Strong Relationships:** We believe in collaboration. We are building ties with manufacturing and shipping companies, as well as educational institutions, to develop stronger systems and reach new audiences together.

### 🟡 Mid Term
As we find our footing, we plan to introduce more advanced automation and organization tools.

* **FXST AUTO:** Our goal is to remove friction from your workflow. This branch will focus on automated workflows, ranging from simple software solutions like automated customer quotes to advanced robotics using "design for automation" principles.
* **Rose:** A future open-source project designed to be a self-organizing vault for your ideas. Rose will help you turn overwhelming creative thoughts into a comprehensive roadmap toward your goals.
* **Expanded Manufacturing:** We aim to grow our local capabilities with better machinery or through white-label partnerships with advanced manufacturers. This allows us to bring modern technologies to regions where they aren't currently accessible.

### 🔴 Long Term
Our big-picture goals involve scaling our physical presence and reaching a global audience.

* **Local Infrastructure:** To provide quicker response times and cheaper parts, we aim to establish a more capable facility that can house expensive equipment like CNC machining and sheet metal fabrication tools.
* **Internationalization:** FXST is for everyone. We plan to support multiple languages and reach audiences far beyond our local region once we can reliably provide the high-quality support they deserve.
* **Global Shipping:** Based in Mexico, we navigate strict import/export policies. We are committed to training our team and ensuring full legal compliance so we can eventually offer secure international shipping.
