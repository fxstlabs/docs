# Welcome to the FXST Documentation

### A Quick Note

<Callout type='error'>Please read this before continuing.</Callout>

While we aren't open to the general public just yet, you are seeing FXST’s growth in real-time because we’ve chosen to
develop and test in "open waters."

FXST is more than just a company; it is a learning project built by people who want to help others grow. This doesn't
mean our tools are experimental or unreliable; it simply means you get a front-row seat as we establish new systems and
introduce new services.

Our promise to you is to deliver reliable systems that "just work," ensuring your day goes as smoothly as possible.
After all, that’s exactly why we’re building this!

## Transparency First

We believe you have the right to fully understand the tools you use. This documentation is designed to show you exactly
how our services operate internally, offering as much transparency as possible.

<Callout type='default'>
    **FXST is a work in progress!** We are slowly but surely expanding our ecosystem. Keep an eye out for new features and services as we continue to build.
