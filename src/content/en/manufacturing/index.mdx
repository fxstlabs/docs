# Manufacturing

At FXST, we’re passionate about helping creators bring their ideas to life. We offer a range of manufacturing services
designed to get your prototypes and products into your hands as quickly as possible.

Whether you are working on a personal hobby or an industrial project, our doors are open to help you grow. While we
strive to keep our services affordable, please note that because these processes rely on external resources, they do carry a cost.

    Because we are a small, growing team, we cannot offer discounts or sponsorships just yet. As we scale, we look
    forward to introducing special pricing for educators and creators!
